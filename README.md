# Hospital Data - Management System


# Data Management and Database Design Project

## Project Name - Designing of Database for taking medical appointments at a hospital chain across US


### Project Problem Statement – To design a database system for taking a medical appointment of doctor’s schedule at a specific hospital and their chains to efficiently manage the appointments, the patient friendly system and streamlining the doctor’s workflow.
 
Introduction: A chain of hospitals in US spread across 5 states and employs number of doctors in various departments like Surgical Department, Nursing Department, Radiology department, Physical medicine, and more. The current medical appointment booking system in this hospital chain is very time consuming and inefficient. This system has resulted in long wait time for patients and productivity loss for doctors. So, this project aims to improve the efficiency of the medical appointment booking system by designing a database for the whole hospital chain which can reduce the patient wait times and streamline the doctor’s workflow.
 
Objective: The primary and main objective of this project is to design and develop a MySQL database for all hospitals and its chain. This database will be able to store all the medical information related to patients, their medical history, and previous doctor’s appointments taken in the past. This database system is designed to ensure data integrity and security by using unique IDs, establishing relationships between multiple tables, and implementing appropriate security measures.


# USE CASES: 

1.	Scheduling patient appointment: Patients will be able to schedule the appointments with their preferred doctor, view their upcoming appointments and receive updates on appointment status.

2.	Doctor availability and scheduling:  Doctors in the whole hospital chain will be able to view their schedule and availability and will be able to manage their patients list.

3.	Patient record management: The database can store important information related to the patients like contact details, medical history, previous appointments, and insurance information.

4.	Reporting and Analytics: The database will be able to generate reports and analytics on patients’ appointment scheduling trends, patient demographics, and other key factors to help optimize the hospital their operations.

5.	Payment Tracking: The database will be able to track patients’ payments and billing information and will make it easier for the hospital office to manage their finances accurately.
